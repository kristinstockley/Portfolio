# Portfolio

This is my (currently template) portfolio to showcase my skills and future projects. You can view the live site at https://kristinstockley.netlify.app/.

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>Netlify (for deployment)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Approach Taken</h2>
My goal was to keep the portfolio simple and clean, with easy navigation. I started with Bootstrap and custom CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing design. Once I had the layout down, I used JavaScript for user interations including my graduation countdown, the dark/light mode toggle, option to scroll to the top, and carousel.


<h2>Unsolved Problems:</h2>
<li>Project card backgrounds changing with Dark/Light Mode</li>
<li>Resume link in navbar staying black after user click</li>
<li>Resume showing 2nd page on mobile</li>
