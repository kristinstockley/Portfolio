# Portfolio

This is my (currently template) portfolio to showcase my skills and future projects. You can view the live site at https://kristinstockley.netlify.app/.


Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Bootstrap
Netlify (for deployment)

Approach Taken
My goal was to keep the portfolio simple and clean, with easy navigation. I started with Bootstrap and custom CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing design. Once I had the layout down, I used JavaScript for user interations including my graduation countdown, the dark/light mode toggle, and option to scroll to the top.


Unsolved Problems:
Project card backgrounds changing with Dark/Light Mode
Resume link in navbar staying black after user click
Resume showing 2nd page on mobile
